# Frontend Image Loading Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Improved Appwrite Image Loading**
   - Added parameters for image width and height to ensure proper image loading
   - Added cache busting to prevent stale images
   - Improved error handling to prevent repeated error messages

2. **Optimized Image Component Attributes**
   - Added `unoptimized` attribute for better handling of external images
   - Added `loading="lazy"` to improve page performance
   - Enhanced error handling with descriptive logs

3. **Problematic Image Handling**
   - Added detection for known problematic image IDs
   - Set up consistent fallback placeholder images
   - Improved logging for bad image requests

## Troubleshooting Guide

If images are still not loading correctly, try the following:

1. **Check the Console**
   Look for image loading errors with trip IDs and image IDs to identify specific problematic images.

2. **403 Errors**
   If seeing 403 Forbidden errors:
   - Verify that the image ID exists in Appwrite storage
   - Check if the image permissions are set correctly
   - Add the problematic image ID to the `problematicImageIds` array in both the Admin and Frontend appwrite.ts files

3. **No Images Loading**
   - Verify that the Appwrite bucket ID and project settings in `.env` are correct
   - Check the network tab for any CORS errors

4. **Trip Card Shows "No trips found"**
   - Verify that the Supabase connection is working by checking logs
   - Look for any fetch errors in the console
   - Confirm that trip data exists in the database and is being returned properly
   - Ensure that the join-trip page has appropriate `"use client"` directive

## Diagnostic Scripts

You can use the following scripts to diagnose image loading issues:

1. **Check Image URLs**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/check-image-urls.js
   ```

2. **Fix Image URLs**:
   ```bash
